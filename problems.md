If you are using a desktop / laptop, follow the below steps :

1) Open an image in google.
2) Click on the image to view the larger version.
3) Right click on the image and select the 'Copy Image Address' option.
4) Paste it on the input box of the website.
5) Click on 'Detect' button.
6) Click on 'Result' button.


Unfortunately, mobile devices doesn't have the 'Copy Image Address' option in the browser.
So currently, if you are using the website in a mobile device, then you can only use the sample image URLs provided in the website at the bottom.

If someone knows a way to copy the "exact" URL of an image in mobile devices, then feel free to text me on linkedin. It will be of great help.

Thankyou for using the Image Moderator web app.
Have a nice day.
